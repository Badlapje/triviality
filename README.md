# Triviality

Dependency Injection is all about code reusability. 
Itâ€™s a design pattern aiming to make high-level code reusable, 
by separating the object creation / configuration from usage. **Triviality** highly aims to keep away from your application code. 
**No magic** injection with tokens, annotations whatsoever. It will use your application code 
as *strictly typed interface* to assure everything is connected properly.

# Installation

To install the stable version:

Special thanks to:

Triviality is inspired by [disco](https://github.com/bitExpert/disco) without the annotations.
