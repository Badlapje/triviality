# Triviality !heading

Dependency Injection is all about code reusability. 
Itâ€™s a design pattern aiming to make high-level code reusable, 
by separating the object creation / configuration from usage. **Triviality** highly aims to keep away from your application code. 
**No magic** injection with tokens, annotations whatsoever. It will use your application code 
as *strictly typed interface* to assure everything is connected properly.
